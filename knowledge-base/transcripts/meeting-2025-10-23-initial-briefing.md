### Opening & Introductions

**David:** Hi.

**Jonny:** Quick hair check. Good morning, David.

**David:** Morning. How are you? Nice to meet you, Jonny.

**Jonny:** Nice to meet you. How's it going?

**David:** Yeah. Good. Thanks. Good. So where should we start? So you're a friend of Gail's, right?

**Jonny:** Yes. Can I just ask. I've got a notetaker on. It's just Granola. Notetaker. Do I have your permission to transcribe the meeting?

**David:** Yeah, good idea.

**Jonny:** Yeah. Cool. Yeah. I'm a friend of Gail's. I was rowing this morning. God, it was cold.

**David:** All right.

**Jonny:** Yeah.

**David:** One of the rowers. Right.

**Jonny:** And I thought I could retire at 37 after doing a lot of big digital agency work and moved back to Scotland. In Covid, my business kind of really suffered. And then. Since then, I've tried being a farmer. And find myself back doing digital projects to kind of pull stuff together. These days, I'm really investing all my time in kind of AI and I help kind of. I do this kind of like, sort of friends and family work. So when Gail told me about this project, I thought, well, what I really like doing is actually helping businesses set up or helping projects define clear context with a view to them.

**David:** Okay?

**Jonny:** Yeah. I think when I was running a business, I never really got close to the coal face. As much as when I was more of a sort of a junior and account manager. But where it pays to get it right these days is to make very unsticky decisions and to build clear process or definition of what it is we're trying to do.

**David:** Right.

**Jonny:** And I'd be willing to do that for you on a no charge basis initially because you are a friend, a friend of Gail's and we can do that as fast for a slow as you like, or I can help you find people that are good, but what are really motivated by is kind of in Fife. Creating opportunity and doing stuff well, so that's kind of who I am. It's a passion.

### AI Services Discussion

**David:** So what do you do? What are you doing with AI? Can you explain a bit more about that?

**Jonny:** Sure. So at the moment, one example is I help lead projects where I've started a growth agency. So I've actually started a business in Glenrothes with two other individuals and we build contact so we can build websites very quickly, very easily. But what we really like to do is we like to give a capture a clear definition. So we start on the. We start on the entity level, so we start with people, but that could also be authors or it could be projects, could be books. And for every entity, we help to define very lightweight text files that just explain what it is. So I have one for me as a person and explains kind of the work that I do. The jobs that I do. And AI is pretty handy in that sense because, honestly, I could build. You could describe a website to me. Give an example. A website. And I could clone and publish and put that website live in 45 seconds. You know, it really is razor fast. There is no market for building websites anymore. I'm working with a guy right now who's an emotional intelligence Coach. He's got three or four published books. He's attempt to do things in YouTube, Google Books, Amazon. He's a published author.

**David:** Really?

**Jonny:** But so I'm just building out. It's quite interesting, actually, because when you get into where someone's put together, they've spent a lot of time doing what I call offline or above the folder. You know, they're public, but they haven't optimized anything. And if you haven't optimized. You can't even find them. I mean, you can't find his main publication in Google Books.

**David:** Yeah.

**Jonny:** Just because it sat there just with. It just is a book called Vicious Cycle. This guy's like a. He's like a world level cyclist and kind of use the word life coach. He doesn't like that.

**David:** Yeah.

**Jonny:** So AI is useful. But also I help joiners. I help build his plumbers, decorators. Just people locally, they're mostly just friends. And I just help them to get into the flow of it. I'm also thinking about putting a sauna in at Wormit. So I just work with a small number of businesses and it's not something that I kind of want to do sort of full time, but if I can, if I can create you. Know, it's better than. It's better than going out and doing it wrong.

**David:** Yeah.

**Jonny:** Because you a lot of people are whitewashing tell you they can do something when they can't.

### IPG & Publishing Industry Context

**David:** So. Did you say building a sauna?

**Jonny:** Yeah, it's built, it's ready to go.

**David:** I think every Scottish home is going to have a sauna. It's just so popular now, and I'm thinking of getting one here. And as I look out at our frosty landscape up in Sutherland, I'm thinking, yeah, sauna down in the garden would be fantastic anyway. Part of the reason I was asking about AI is that I'll fill you in on where we're at. But I had a long career in publishing. This is a sort of. I hesitate to use the word retirement project. But I didn't try and retire at 37. But I am trying to retire. Now, but not fully, because I love books and I love working in the industry and I don't want to vegetate here in the Highlands and I want to do give something back. So that's a small project.

**Jonny:** Great.

**David:** But why I was asking about AI is that as part of my career. I was chair of an organization called the IPG, which is the Independent Publisher's Guild, which is an industry body that. Represents the interests of about. I think it's about 650 independent publishers, from the very, very, very small like us, to the very large like Bloomsbury is the biggest, most high profile. But technically, although it's a bit of a stretch, independent publisher, and they got on the AI revolution pretty early.

**Jonny:** Yeah.

**David:** On to their. To their credit. And they hold two conferences a year. One has just been and the other next one is up in February. Where AI often plays a significant role in people coming to talk about the opportunities and the threats of AI to publishing. Because publishers are very conflicted as to whether this is the new devil or whether it is something that can help their business or kill their business. And if you wanted to, I could introduce you to the chief executive because we have guest speakers come along and give talks where they are explaining what they do.

**Jonny:** Great.

**David:** And it could be a good source of future clients for you to be introduced. Not, I have to say, to warn you, very wealthy clients, because independent publishing is not a money making enterprise.

**Jonny:** I'm aware.

**David:** Generally, but good, interesting people who might very well be interested in what you do in the services that you can offer. So down the line, if that's something that I can offer back to you, I'd be very happy to make the introductions. They have their own resident AI expert and a running training courses on AI. For their publishers by a guy called George Weekly, who was digital director at Hachette and then left and went freelance. And he is running very successful courses on what is AI, how can you use it, what are the pitfalls, what are the risks?

**Jonny:** That's great.

**David:** What's the legal situation? As this very exciting area develops, there's an endless source of new information that needs to be shared and disseminated to the membership. So if that is something that might be of interest, you would certainly have your expenses paid. I think for keynote speakers, they offer a fee. Often people do it because they see the benefits. To them of getting in front of 650 publishers who may well want to hire their services. I don't know which side you would fall on. That wouldn't be my goal. I was on the board until the summer, but I'd finish my term of I think it's six years. I'D been on that board and then you have to step down. But I'm still in touch with Bridget Schein, who's a great chief executive. So if that was of interest, you can send me a more formal detail stuff and I can pass it on.

**Jonny:** That's great.

### North House Press Overview

**David:** So this sounds really interesting. I mean, where we are. My wife, Kirsty - Gail may have explained. As a writer. Professor of creative writing at Dundee University.

**Jonny:** Yeah.

**David:** And she and I have harbored a desire to create a tiny little publishing company that will only publish books that we really love and feel passionate about, and that is in motion. It's called North House Press. And we will launch our inaugural program in spring next year, May next year. Next year we've got on the slate five books, and that's kind of the level we're going to be at. It's a lifestyle enterprise. If we were to have a mission statement, they would be not to lose money because we're not really in it to make our fortunes, but to publish. Books that we feel need to be published, and it'll be a mixture of new titles and reissuing lost classics. Centered around Scottish culture in its broadest terms. And we are actually starting with three books in May by the great Highland writer called Neil Gunn. I don't know. Do you know Neil Gunn? And I was interested to know whether people have heard of Neil Gunn.

**Jonny:** I know. Well, I don't think so.

**David:** You're not alone and this is why.

**Jonny:** I heard of it, obviously. The Silver Darlings, Yeah. That's about herring, right?

**David:** The silver darlings are the herring. Yes. It's about life in the Highlands and families and things. It's a wonderful book. Still in print in favor of principally because it's the only book that occasionally appears on Scottish university reading lists. But a lot of his books have been out of print.

**Jonny:** Here.

**David:** And he's a really interesting writer. He was born in Dumbeth and Caithness, basically lived all his life in the Highlands, and he wrote 20 novels, all of which are based in the Highlands and populated by Highland people. But in his day, he was regarded as one of the great writers of the 20th century. He was published all over the world. He was highly regarded modernist. And his rather fallen off the radar, as your lack of knowledge by them indicates. And widely speaking to a lot of people who are really big readers. And they go, oh, yeah, Neil Gunn. Yeah, I think I've heard of him. No, I've never read him. So we're bringing three of his books back into print, one of which is his debut, which was published in 1926. For which, of course, it's the centenary, which is the PR hook that we're hanging the project on. And to give you an idea of his status. So this book is called the Grey Coast. It set very clearly up near Dumbeth or that part of the world. And is about love story. I suppose the simplest. And the dialogue isn't quite broad. Scott's I had to go to my Scott's dictionary to look up a couple of words I wasn't familiar with. And it was published by Jonathan Cape. Now, Jonny Cape, you don't need to know, but Jonny Cape is like one of the leading English literary publishers. Publishers today, Ian McEwen and Salman Rushdie and all sorts of Booker Prize winning novelists. And what really intrigues me is that idea that this guy who'd nevertheless Dumbeth was writing was unknown. He'd written a few essays and things for a Scottish magazines. But nothing published. This manuscript lands on the desk of an editor in Garris street in Bloomsbury in London. And he looks at this book and thinks, yeah, this is something I can publish. And was published. And then he then Gunn went on to be published by Faber and Faber, arguably the most prestigious literary publishing house, certainly in Britain, arguably. In the world for the rest of his career. So he really transcends. There's a great quote about him transcending regionality to universality. So he's a great, great writer and he is part of the Scottish literary canon, but has been largely forgotten about. So our project is to bring back these. Books into print that should be in print and try and restore his status to its rightful place right at the head of Scottish literary fiction.

**Jonny:** Yes.

**David:** So that is the start of it. Then in the autumn, I think we'll do another book by him, a nonfiction book. And our one new book is Closer to home, and closer to your home, in fact, by a Dundee based poet called Beth McDonough, who is a wild swimmer, so you might have to row around. Her in the Tay because the Tay is her favorite swimming spot and she.

**Jonny:** Evan, welcome to.

**David:** Well, I think you'll love Beth's book. She's a poet and a wild swimmer, and this is called A Year In Water. And what we asked her to do was just talk about wild swimming round a calendar year. And provide practical tips and advice, little insights into what to have. As I think this is a universal term, it was certainly a family name. A chittery bite is a chittery bite. You know what a chittery bite is? What you eat when you get out of the water, freezing cold when you're chittering.

**Jonny:** Revite? No, but you know, I love.

**David:** Maybe that's just a family word. I don't know.

**Jonny:** Quizzes. I'm slowly getting my University Challenge questions lined up here. So keep going.

**David:** And really lovely poems about the experience of wild swimming. So I'm a keen swimmer of the rivers and lochs and seas around here, but I am pretty seasonal.

**Jonny:** Great.

**David:** But beth's poems. Put you in the Tay in February, up to your knees in icy water and really provide the experience, if you want to know what that's like, but actually not go through the pain of actually doing it yourself. So that's going to be a really lovely book.

**Jonny:** All right.

**David:** So that's the kind of outline of our program, which is going to be small and will stay small. We've got sales and distribution worked out, we've got production doing, we've got proofreading on the three books going ahead. But what we don't have yet is a website. So if there was a way to start with you, which would be to make us a website, that would be fantastic.

### Website Requirements Discussion

**Jonny:** Good. Any examples of websites that you like? I'm also building it from scratch, but I've worked with Penguin doing their SEO. That was a big deal and I'm looking right now. I've got lots of ideas. Specifically, I spend a lot of money on buying old books and books through eBay. Secondhand books. Probably one of my biggest outlays in the last year, and it's driven a lot by quotes of things I see on social media.

**David:** Right.

**Jonny:** And I see something that really speaks to me.

**David:** Yeah.

**Jonny:** And then I know I can go buy it. It's not a very rich market. In fact, it's terrible. Probably because it's a discarded book. It's written on, it's a pound. But I definitely think there's ways to market books. And I was looking at Neil Gunn's profile on Google Books. I'm always interested in what we call, like, the. If there's a single source of truth. For online, and I don't know if it is online, but where is the. I guess for publishers, what is the single source of truth? Is it like ISBN or is it some kind of. Where is every book listed? Because the Grey Coast, it actually does have Jonathan Cape limited, but there's very limited information around it. And actually you search online, therefore, for something or for quotes. You know, you want to get books, kind of. You do, I think you want to get books indexed and you want to push and promote them, and that will drive sales. Just from my kind of magpie attention culture, these special young people.

**David:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

**Jonny:** It's not really about them getting them to read the books, though, because I don't think they read them, they buy them.

**David:** Yeah. Y. Eah. Y. Eah. Yeah, well, they certainly do. Yeah. Well, the ISBN, I suppose, is the single source of truth.

**Jonny:** Right.

**David:** But being a legacy industry, of course. As you delve back into the digital age. I mean, I've been trying to find out more about the Grey Coast. And I'd love to find more about the story about how that manuscript reached. You know, if you. If you imagine the distance that traveled From Dumbeth in 1926 to Bloomsbury in 1926, it's kind of crossing so many borders and boundaries.

**Jonny:** Yes.

**David:** It's a fascinating journey.

**Jonny:** I'm still here.

**David:** Are you still there? Right.

**Jonny:** Yes.

**David:** So I could. I could certainly have it. I mean, we. Want to keep things as simple as possible. We're small, and what I'm mindful of is the voracious appetite and websites. And I've looked at too many websites that have news and events. Tabs that start with an event that happened, you know, a year ago that they haven't updated.

**Jonny:** Yeah.

**David:** And it is worse than having nothing. So I've. I've. I've sort of written out, just as a word document, the kind of very simple architecture of what we would want.

**Jonny:** Brilliant. Do you have it?

**David:** And I think, yeah, I can send that to you for sure after this. After this meeting.

**Jonny:** Okay? Roughly. It's not frequent updates, but it obviously needs some architecture for the book, details the ability to purchase the book.

**David:** Yeah, I'd like to have a. I'd like. Yes, definitely. I'd like to have a shopping cart on there for both print and. And ebooks, because we have. We have ebook rights as well.

**Jonny:** Okay? And with that, put an order into your own distribution straight away.

**David:** It was we, we would do it ourselves from here.

**Jonny:** Great. Okay, good.

**David:** Direct. Because, you know, bookshops take at least 50% of the, of the, of the cover price, often, often more. So reaching it through anywhere else, we lose a lot of margin. And, you know, there's not much margin to play with because our print runs are going to be small, so our print cost is high.

**Jonny:** Yeah. Thank you.

**David:** So the more was that.

**Jonny:** Derek. That's good, though, because, I mean, when you describe that situation, I'm thinking basically the ability for you to receive an order and for it to seamlessly become a printed label that you just stick on. Under your post rather than it being like, oh, well, I can put it in a spreadsheet and then you have to type it and copy it and write it down. It's nice to have you want something slick you can be proud of.

**David:** Yeah. Y. Eah. Yeah.

**Jonny:** That last five years rather than it being end up sending books to the wrong place and things like that.

**David:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I think the volume of traffic where we're at is. That would be nice, but. But I'm not sure it would be essential if I'm. If I'm. If I'm quite honest, we would just, you know, handwrite labels and so on. But the ability to transact financially so that people can, you know, pay and, and having a. A pretty, you know, I think we would restrict it to UK only. I'm hearing so much. I mean, so many much bigger publishers have just given up trying to supply into the EU because of post Brexit regulations. It's just. It's just a nightmare. And America and Australia is a long, long way away. And there are frankly, there are much better ways of customers act getting hold of our books via Amazon and Gardner as the big wholesaler than buying direct from us and us going through. Now in America, my wife just got something sent to her by a friend and she had to go and pay £20. Tariff for, for something that was being sent from one friend to another across the Atlantic. So I think. I think we'd probably be doing UK and Ireland fulfillment only. And that's where, frankly, 80% of the 90% of the demand will come from, in any case. So there's just the two of us. And neither of us are very technologically minded, so I. I don't want to limit your ambitions. But we will be a limit on your ambitions just by our ability to do. To do things that are in any way technically complicated. I need to put my hands up to. That right away. So, you know, if, if, if you're prepared to build us a website, Pro bono, that would be absolutely wonderful.

**Jonny:** Sure. Yeah. I mean, I might want some books out of it. I don't know.

**David:** That is payment for. Everyone we're working with is a set of. They are going to be very, very beautiful books in hardcover.

**Jonny:** Yeah. And I like to charge for anything. That is, if I have to go get help, obviously. So I'm not going to pay for things you need to pay for.

**David:** Yeah. Of course.

**Jonny:** And I like to set it up so it's detachable. So I just run it through, like, Gmail, Google Docs. And I just log everything as I go so that someone can pick it up. If all of a sudden, as has happened, you know, someone. 's one of your friends daughters. Once they get involved in the social media or something, that's when I start to go a bit like, this is gonna, like, snowball on me. So then I go like, it's not a bad breakup. I'm just like, You know, if you want me to train an 18 year old, fine, but that's not kind of how we started.

**David:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Jonny:** This happened.

**David:** Yeah, yeah.

**Jonny:** Recently, but. Yeah, I mean, how usually works is I would just take your brief and feedback on it, but this sounds like it would be found a lead. And I'm not gonna start using terms like kind of go to market.

**David:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Jonny:** Or buying Journey or committees. But I am looking at a file right now that kind of. That defines that kind of structure where it's like we do kind of like found a lead interviews and we just get you to talk a little bit like you have done now. Where you just lay stuff out. To be honest, this is kind of good enough for me. And then there's things like kind of color schemes, palettes, fonts, things like that. And I don't have a process for that, per se, and it's pretty much just. It can just be trial and error.

**David:** Yeah.

**Jonny:** But maybe you've thought about that. I mean, your wallpaper looks well chosen.

**David:** Yeah. That was once my wife's choice. This wallpaper is.

**Jonny:** That's why I'm feeling that she might have a view on. Flate grade or I don't know.

**David:** Well, we have. We, we, we. I can send you the. The assets that we have. In fact, I've just got high res front covers in from our designer for the first three Gunn books. And we've obviously got a logo and a letterhead and all that sort of corporate stuff, which would obviously make you be carried over onto the website. And I think it's pretty straightforward. I think our primary logo, the only color in it is a kind of a moss green, not dissimilar to the. Wallpaper behind and we would use you that, that the logo would obviously feature at the top of every page. And if there was any color, we probably just pick up that color for the, for the, for the headers. And I think there are. I think there are like, you know, six. Six pages, if you like home books. Authors, news and events. Contacts and submissions policy, I think is all. All it is. It's very, very simple. We want to. We want to keep it simple. I mean, we would have a news events thing. There, but I want to have a rider at the top saying we're very small and if this looks out of date, contact us at this email because we're trying to keep things up to date. But we may fail because I just see so many people. Setting off with great ambitions on websites, and then they don't have the time or the bandwidth to maintain it, as with these shoes. And. And they get it. It gets out of there quite quickly.

### Glassbox Ebook Platform Discussion

**Jonny:** Nice. One of the other things I'm doing at the moment. Is sorry.

**David:** The only. Thing. Well, just one thing that would be worth exploring, I think, is that I worked with a in. In lockdown. I was running a. A much bigger but still pretty small publishing company, and. We were, you know, obviously in a bit of a panic about what lockdown was going to mean to. For publishing. Actually, it was, it was an absolute boon because everyone stayed at home, couldn't go out and spend money on food and drink and cinemas and bought books instead, so publishers had a very, very good pandemic. But as a measure, we appended an ebook selling widget onto our website called Glassbox. Have you ever come across Glassbox? It's probably a publishing thing.

**Jonny:** No.

**David:** And they. They handled all the ebook sales for the business that I was running. And we sold a surprising number of ebooks, given that we were an illustrated publisher, which tends not to do very well with ebooks. But for the. For the. It might be expedient to use Glassbox again, I think. I think. I think they charged 20% sales commission, which I'm fine with. And they picked up all the. All the stuff. And I think they may have actually held the digital files. I can't quite remember it's. A long time ago now. And also someone else did it for me, but that's just to just throw that into the mix.

**Jonny:** There's quite complicated. Well, it's got a lot of features. Glass box is a. Yeah. So it's basically like a custom user journey platform. Yeah. So it's CRO. Okay, that's cool. You built that product.

**David:** No, no, no, no, no. We bought it.

**Jonny:** Oh. Oh, you bought the business or you bought as a solution?

**David:** No, we bought the service.

**Jonny:** Okay, this exist. All of a sudden you go, I don't know, technology to.

**David:** No.

**Jonny:** Octopus.

**David:** They came to me and said, hey, what are you doing about sales now that all the bookshops are shut?

**Jonny:** Right.

**David:** We can sell your ebooks off your website. And I went, well, yeah, we don't know what we're doing here. We think our business might be going down the cheap. We'll try anything we can to sell some books.

**Jonny:** Yeah.

**David:** And they plug that service into our existing website very quickly and, as far as I'm aware, frictionlessly. And then we sold quite a lot of ebooks which were not very ebookable because they were all illustrated cookbooks and guides to nature and things, which is not what people buy ebooks for.

**Jonny:** It's interesting. I'm not. I'm not sold in ebooks. And as you're saying it to me, I've gone from the romance of, you know. Gunn. And what you described. And then, like, ebooks are just. I've never been a kindler.

**David:** Yeah, me neither. Me neither.

**Jonny:** I really don't like it. But yeah, we have to have it. I was interested to know the split of people buying ebooks versus paper.

**David:** Yeah, I've been out of it. Varies, of course. The business I just left, it was about 5% of our revenue. Was e.

**Jonny:** Okay?

**David:** But our books were as unappealing on ebook as you could make. Pretty much. We had a chess instruction list which did quite well for obvious reasons. If you want to learn about the complexities of Gary Kasparov's chess moves, you can read it on ears as well as you can on paper. But most of our list wasn't really appropriate. I think fiction is hovering around 20 to 30% of sales. But the sales are much more profitable because, of course, there's no manufacturer cost involved. I mean, the prices are lower, but there is no transaction cost other than the commission you're being charged. By people like Glass Box or others. So it's a revenue stream that we can't ignore. And I agree. I think, honestly, the demographic for these books will be at the older end. We're wanting to enthuse young people. Young people about the writing of Neil Gunn. It's a tall challenge to get a kid interested in book setting. The Highlands 100 years ago.

**Jonny:** Yeah, well, you never know.

**David:** But you never know.

**Jonny:** Yeah.

**David:** It's not what I meant to say. If you've heard of this not so new. Have you heard of Romantasy? As my next question.

**Jonny:** Things I haven't heard about. Really stupid.

### Technical Approach & Next Steps

**David:** Jonny, if you got started from your end, I would be.

**Jonny:** Yeah. Don't make me open up my AI integrated development environment and start running circle grinders.

**David:** Yeah, yeah.

**Jonny:** I will build you a prototype quickly, for free. I think we'll need Shopify or an ecommerce platform. I'll avoid the temptation of doing it kind of from scratch or really lightweight or anything. I'll just go with, like a standard. I'll have a look as well. I don't know if there's any. I do not interested in any bespoke Made for publishers. Made for. You know, there's. No CMS or you're not really love. Someone doesn't love WordPress or, you know, there's no penchant for WooCommerce or something like that. There was a technologies, right?

**David:** Right. Well, WordPress is, I think, is the most commonly used website builder in publishing, but I don't think it makes. I'm an agnostic as far as that's concerned. I don't care, as long as it works.

**Jonny:** Sure. Yeah, well, someone's gonna have to, you know, use it to publish the books potentially. At some point. I'm happy to do it, but, you know, it's good that someone else knows how to do it, so it needs to be friendly enough. It is possible just to do it through. It is possible just to do it in a kind of managed way or through AI. I'm a fan of it. It's a bit. Not many people are doing it, but, you know, it is as simple as. Drag and dropping the images and stuff in and then just playing around with the page. But I think it might raise an eyebrow if that was suggested to visiting. Oh, that's not really supported going forward. And that's the thing, right? It's like you need to have a website that if you're going to come to rely on it in three years time,

**David:** Yeah.

**Jonny:** With 20 titles on it. You know it needs to be updated and you know, you might capturing user details and all of a sudden you've actually got an ecommerce build.

**David:** Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

**Jonny:** But for now, we just want something so that when we send an email to somebody, They can look up and see something incredible.

**David:** Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So I'm a bit confused what you were saying there. Would you be building in WordPress or would you be doing something else?

**Jonny:** I don't know yet. I don't know yet.

**David:** All right.

**Jonny:** I'm going to think about it because it's possible that I'm building an MVP for you. Pro bono, and I want to do it well and quickly. And then we can see how it's gone thus far. The more information.

**David:** What's on? MVP. Wasn't mvp.

**Jonny:** Minimum viable product.

**David:** No m all right.

**Jonny:** So I'm building you a basic. Like a version. I won't say 0.1, but a version 1.0, that's for sure. Wish I could do. Probably really quickly, just depending on how much context I need to gather from you guys.

**David:** Okay?

**Jonny:** And you can send me some books.

**David:** I'll send you some content and you can use what you want. Have you got? We don't have email addresses. Oh, yes, you do. You emailed me the.

**Jonny:** Good. I've got a few different ones. I'm just trying to work out if this is so. I've got Caliber Interactive, which is a business. I've got Caliber Network Effect. And then there's just me as a sole trader. And this is definitely just me as me doing it for. Because I can. Claim some expenses and tweak my personal tax rather than my corporate stuff.

**David:** Right. Yeah. Great.

**Jonny:** My work or you think you want to pay me at some point, you can also do that. I feel like I've taught myself out of a fee, but for now, I'm quite into what you're doing. And I'll let you know.

**David:** Let's get this started. Now I would want to pay you down, down the line if you're willing to do the MVP to have a look at and if we like it and go ahead, then we can work out something. I'm not going to make you rich, I can tell you that because.

**Jonny:** Perfect. I know that, but Gail will tell me. Why didn't you ask him for money?

**David:** We will. No, no, I would definitely want to do that.

**Jonny:** Good, sir. Okay, well, that's great. Send me over what you.

**David:** Do you want to ping me the email address you want to use onto my North House press email?

**Jonny:** Yeah, I will. I'm actually going to set one up in Gmail, but for now, for me, if you're sharing stuff on Google Docs or just generally, then the one I sent you this morning, J. Malcolm scott@gmail.com works. For the next week.

**David:** Okay? Let me. Just.

**Jonny:** As you asked. I will send it.

**David:** I got it. I've got it, I've got it. Right, sorry, I've just lost you there.

**Jonny:** Okay?

**David:** Okay, I've got your email. I'll send you. I'll send you a bunch of stuff and if you need anything else, shout, but I'll send you everything. I can think of that might be useful.

**Jonny:** Good. I'm going to start looking over my book collection now and see what I haven't been reading.

**David:** Brilliant. Yeah, definitely. We'll definitely get you copies of our beautiful books as soon as we have them, which will be early in the new year.

**Jonny:** Well.

**David:** Really nice meeting you.

**Jonny:** Good to meet you. Too.

**David:** And you prefer to be called Jonny or Jon or Jonny's. Jonny. That's nice. Okay, thanks a lot. Speak soon. Yeah. Bye now.

**Jonny:** Jonny's good. Yeah, Jonny's good. Thank you, David. All right.
