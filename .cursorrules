### Initial Book List
1. **Neil Gunn Revival** (3 books):
   - "The Grey Coast" (1926 debut) - centenary PR hook
   - Originally published by Jonathan Cape, later Faber & Faber
   - 20 novels total, all Highland-based

## Technical Stack

### Core Platform
- **WordPress** - Standard choice for publishing industry

- **Shipping**: UK/Ireland only (geographic restrictions)
- **Fulfillment**: Direct fulfillment to avoid bookshop margins (50%+)
- **Small Print Runs**: High costs, need maximum margin retention

### Ebook Integration
- **Glassbox Integration**: 20% commission model
- **Ebook Sales**: Fiction ebooks ~20-30% of sales vs 5% for illustrated books

### User Experience Considerations

## Notes

- Consider maintenance and update requirements
- Payment discussion for future development phases
- Book copies as partial compensation when available (early 2025)
