## Email Draft

Hi David,

I hope you're well. I wanted to give you a quick update on where we are with the North House Press project.

**What's Been Completed:**

I've set up an interim website that's now live on Netlify. This serves as a central hub where you and Kirsty can:

- **View all project assets** - Book covers, documents, and materials you've sent are organized and accessible
- **Review documentation** - Brand guidelines, customer profiles, hosting research, and technology plans
- **See meeting notes** - The transcript from our initial briefing call is available
- **Check copywriting analysis** - Content strategy and writing guidelines based on our discussions
- **Track updates** - Progress log as the project develops

The site is built with Next.js and is fully responsive, so it works well on any device. It's designed with your moss green branding in mind and keeps things simple and easy to navigate.

**How to Access:**

The website is deployed and will automatically update whenever I push changes. You can access it at the Netlify URL (I can send you the specific link once it's configured, or it may already be connected to your GitHub repository).

**Next Steps & Interaction:**

- **Email me** anytime with questions, feedback, or new assets (logos, additional book covers, etc.)
- **Check the website** regularly - I'll update it as we progress, so you can see changes in real-time
- **Review documents** - All the strategy documents, research, and plans are there for your review

**What's Next:**

Once you've had a chance to review everything, we can discuss:
- Finalizing the WordPress site architecture
- Choosing hosting (I've researched UK-based options)
- Integrating Glassbox for ebook sales
- Setting up the e-commerce functionality

The interim site gives us a good foundation to work from, and everything is documented so we can move forward efficiently when you're ready.

Let me know if you'd like to discuss anything or if you have questions about what's been set up.

Best regards,

Jonny
